This plugin imports events from ics resources into wordpress using the events manager plugin.

== Description ==

The ICS Events Importer plugin for WordPress is an easy-to-use tool that allows users to import events
from ICS files or ICS URLs into WordPress sites running the Events Manager plugin. With this plugin,
users can quickly and accurately transfer event information, including date, time, location, and
other relevant details, directly into their Events Manager calendars.

To ensure reliable and consistent results, the ICS Events Importer plugin relies on the widely used
[PHP ICS parser library](https://github.com/u01jmg3/ics-parser) developed by Jonathan
Goode. This library provides the backbone for the plugin's ability to efficiently parse and process
ICS event information.

The ICS Events Importer plugin has been inspired by the work of Tom Rose with the popular
[Sunflower theme](https://sunflower-theme.de/).
